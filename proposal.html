        <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
            <p>
                Our group is interested in where the different bike racks on campus are. Many people bike to campus and need places to park their bikes. 
                We have decided to focus on the lack of public information about the different locations of bike racks on campus. 
                While a seasoned campus-biker may know where their favorite places to park, the thousands of new students attending UW every year might not know where to park their bike. 
                For example, the first time Alex biked to campus, he followed Google Maps to a lecture hall on the quad, but there was no bike rack nearby. 
                If he had been able to have an application that would have showed him where the bike racks on campus were, he would have just had google maps route him to the bike rack closest to his lecture hall.
                Similar solutions have been done before, such as a map of every bike rack in downtown Seattle, populated by information from a dataset of the bike rack locations, and information about them. 
                There have also been other applications that allow users to upload bike rack locations. For example, <a href="https://bicycleparking.org/introduction">The Bicycle Parking Project</a> allows
                users to upload locations and photos of bike racks to the app. However, nothing of this sort has been done specifically for the UW campus, leaving us with an opening to iterate on this idea by
                developing meaningful additions by focusing on a smaller scale (campus-wide rather than global) that will be more managable to create targeted features for.
                We hope to be the ones to solve this problem in a manner that is catered for Huskies.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                This application will be targeted at UW students primarily, as well as other residents of the U-District. Users of this application will be
                people who use a bicycle to commute to school, work, or other activities and are looking for a safe place to store their bike. The users will
                be accessing CSV files containing spatial data associated with bike racks in their area. This data will be collected by our team manually as
                there are no available datasets containing spatial information of bike racks in the U-District. Users will be able to see bike rack locations
                on a map interface and get information of number of available spots (capacity), type of rack, and the condition after hovering over the data point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the application the user will be able to use the interactive map to locate and add the locations of varying types of bike racks that are in
                their local area. They can interact with their own account and add their favorite location and filter the different types of bike racks and select
                the type of bike that they have. The problem that we have noticed is that many bike racks are not populated on the most popular navigation applications.
                A lot of the locations are either incorrect or the bike rack has been removed. We also noticed that there are no filtering features that tell you how
                many spaces are within the bike rack as well as if the bike rack is covered or is near electricity so you could potentially charge your ebike if you
                have one.
